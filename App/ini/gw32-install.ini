[ezw:rcs]
ver=5.7-1
desc=This is a port of the official RCS v5.7.13 source to MS-Windows. I did this port because the existing GnuWin32 port was broken: any RCS command that required running another program as a subprocess (e.g., rcsdiff) would either crash or produce an error message, due to an unhandled problem in the Windows versions of the spawn* library functions.

[ezw:flip]
ver=1.19
desc=This is a Windows port of the flip utility, which converts newline format between Unix LF and DOS/Windows CR-LF conventions. Its home page is http://packages.debian.org/sid/flip. I like this utility better than unix2dos/dos2unix, because (a) it is a single program, (b) it does not try to convert character sets, (c) it changes files in-place while keeping their time stamp intact, and (d) it keeps its claws off any binary files, so it is safe.

[ezw:findutils]
ver=4.2.30-w32
desc=This is a Windows port of GNU Findutils 4.2.30. It includes all the binaries in the original distribution, even those, such as code.exe, frcode.exe, and bigram.exe that you are not supposed to need. I made this port because the GnuWin32 port of v4.2.20 had several grave problems: find.exe was abysmally slow, xargs.exe did not work at all, and neither did locate.exe. This port includes updatedb.bat, which is a stripped-down replacement for the original updatedb Unix shell script. Please note that xargs.exe in this distribution has some issues that cause it to fail sometimes. But find.exe and locate.exe work flawlessly for me for several years.

[ezw:idutils]
ver=3.2.99
desc=This is a Windows port of GNU ID Utils. ID Utils and the corresponding Emacs front end is an essential part of my Emacs-based development tool-chain. Without ID Utils, there is no easy way of finding your ways in a large and complex software project.

[ezw:texinfo]
ver=4.13a-w32
desc=This is a Windows port of the GNU Texinfo package, version 4.13a. My reasons for making this port are (1) the makeinfo.exe available from GnuWin32 crashes for any non-trivial Texinfo source; and (2) info.exe refuses to work on Windows because no one bothered to make its terminal display code work on Windows. This port solves both of these problems.

[ezw:ministat]
ver=1.0-w32
desc=This is a Windows port of the ministat program, you can find the original sources here

[ezw:man]
name=Man
ver=1.4
desc=Unix man command for Windows. Unlike all the other packages on this page, this one is not a port. It is a clone of its Unix namesake, and has absolutely no code common with its cousins. I wrote it originally as part of the DJGPP project (http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/), and later updated it to compile with MinGW and run on MS-Windows as a native Windows program. If you want to view unformatted man pages, you will have to install a port of Groff (it is available from this page, see below).

[ezw:grep]
ver=2.10-w32
desc=The latest port available from GnuWin32 is of version 2.5.4, which was released in Feb 2009, quite some time ago. Also, it always annoyed me that color highlighting of Grep matches is not available on MS-Windows. This port of the latest release 2.10 of Grep fixes that.

[ezw:pcre]
ver=8.21-w32
desc=Library of Perl-compatible regular expressions. I needed this to build Grep capable of "grep -P" mode.

[ezw:groff]
ver=1.21-w32
desc=I successfully used Groff-1.19.1 from GnuWin32 for several years. However, the latest man pages emit more and more error messages, because Groff 1.19 does not support several new roff features. GnuWin32 offers version 1.20, but it was released in Jan 2009, and at least its source GnuWin32 distribution suspiciously lacks several important directories. 

[ezw:gnutls]
ver=3.0.9-w32
desc=The previous widely available Windows port of GnuTLS was of version 2.11, which is now a major release ago. So I thought it was high time to have a newer version.

[ezw:wget]
ver=1.13.4-w32
desc=The GnuWin32 port is of version 1.11.4, which was released a few years ago. This is the latest released version, as of this writing (Jan 2012).

[ezw:file]
ver=5.09-w32
desc=The latest GnuWin32 port is of version 5.03, released in May 2009. It has a subtle bug that breaks libtool, and also a few Windows specific gotchas (e.g., try "file NUL" or "file -"). This port of the latest upstream release fixes those bugs.

[ezw:gmp]
ver=5.0.2-w32 
desc=GMP (the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic library)

[ezw:libidn]
ver=1.23-w32
desc=Libidn (the GNU IDN library), Nettle (a cryptographic library)

[ezw:nettle]
ver=2.4-w32 
desc=A cryptographic library

[ezw:p11-kit]
ver=0.9-w32
desc=A package to load and enumerate PKCS#11 cryptographic modules

[ezw:libxml2]
ver=2.7.8-w32
desc=The available Windows ports are compiled with MSVC, which means they are not 100% compatible with MinGW. The libxml2 sources include a JScript configuration script, suitable for running with cscript, and a bunch of Makefiles to go with it. But it looks like this suffered some bitrot, and it does not support running the test suite, which was important for me to make sure the build is dependable.
